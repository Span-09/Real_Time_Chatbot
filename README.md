Real-Time Chat Web App:
  The purpose of this project is to build a production-ready real-time web chat application using only Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and Firebase.

Day 1: Static UI Layout
  This marks the completion of the first day's assignment, focusing on creating the static user interface for the chat screen.

Problem Statement
  The objective for Day 1 was to create the visual layout of a chat screen using only HTML and CSS. The specific requirements were to:

  Design a single 
  chat.html page.
  The layout must include:
  A fixed top bar with a room title and back button.
  A scrollable chat area.
  Message bubbles with left/right alignment based on the sender.
  Timestamps below each message.
  An input field with a "Send" button.
  Ensure the layout is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices using media queries.

What Was Implemented Today:

  The core HTML structure was created in chat.html using semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <footer>) to represent the different sections of the UI.
  The complete styling was developed in style.css, using Flexbox to manage the overall page layout and alignment of components.
  Message bubbles were styled to appear on the right for "sent" messages and on the left for "received" messages.
  The chat area was made vertically scrollable for message history.
  The layout's responsiveness was implemented using a media query to ensure a seamless experience on both large screens and mobile devices.
  The static versions of the stretch goals were also implemented, including date separators between messages and a "typing..." indicator.

Firebase Collections and Data Format Used:
  N/A for Day 1. The implementation was purely static HTML and CSS, with no backend integration.

How to Run and Test the App:
  Clone the repository to your local machine.
  Ensure the chat.html and style.css files are located in the same directory.
  Open the chat.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
  To test responsiveness, open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and toggle the device toolbar to view the layout on different screen sizes.
